New Project to create a vagrant puppet master.

Installed NTP from puppet labs and pushes it out onto the nodes when puppet is run.

Manual steps:

Once run, on the puppet master do the following:

sudo service puppetmaster status # test that puppet master was installed
sudo service puppetmaster stop
sudo puppet master --verbose --no-daemonize
# Ctrl+C to kill puppet master
sudo service puppetmaster start
sudo puppet cert list --all # check for 'puppet' cert

On the puppet nodes:

sudo service puppet status # test that agent was installed
sudo puppet agent --test --waitforcert=60 # initiate certificate signing request (CSR)

Back on the puppet master:

sudo puppet cert list # should see 'node01.example.com' cert waiting for signature
sudo puppet cert sign --all # sign the agent node certs
sudo puppet cert list --all # check for signed certs

I'll be adding to this to customize the puppet modules as part of my work to test puppet modules I'll be deploying with satellite 6. I'll also be introducing Jenkins into the mix in another VM to setup and run my puppet modes and test.

I'll be using bats tests which can be found here. They are easy to write and meet my testing requirements:

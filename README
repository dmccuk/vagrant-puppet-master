Vagrant Puppet Master
=========================
This is the configuration file for my Udemy course to create a puppet master in Vagrant.

Credits:
--------
 * When I was learning Vagrant and puppet I did alot of research on the internet and found some useful code which I modified to suit my needs. I'd like to thanks garystafford/multi-vagrant-puppet-vms for his help.

Setup:
--------
 1. Make you way to the directory you want to clone this code into.
 2. Run this command: git clone https://github.com/dmccuk/vagrant-puppet-master.git
 3. cd into the vagrant-puppet-master directory
 4. Run the vagrant command : vagrant up
 5. (For Windows) Setup the path to ssh running this command: set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin
 6. SSH into your new puppet master: vagrant ssh

Manual steps:
--------
Once run, on the puppet master do the following:

 1. Check the puppet master is installed:
     sudo service puppetmaster status
 2. Stop the puppet master:
     sudo service puppetmaster stop
 3. Run this command:
     sudo puppet master --verbose --no-daemonize
 4. This command will not complete but it's safe to stop it. Do the following:
      Ctrl+C to kill puppet master
 5. Restart the puppet master:
     sudo service puppetmaster start
 6. Check the puppet master is running:
     sudo service puppetmaster status
 7. Check that the puppet master certificate is in place:
     sudo puppet cert list --all # check for 'puppet' cert

---
On the puppet nodes:

sudo service puppet status # test that agent was installed
sudo puppet agent --test --waitforcert=60 # initiate certificate signing request (CSR)

Back on the puppet master:

sudo puppet cert list # should see 'node01.example.com' cert waiting for signature
sudo puppet cert sign --all # sign the agent node certs
sudo puppet cert list --all # check for signed certs

New Project to create a vagrant puppet master.

Installed NTP from puppet labs and pushes it out onto the nodes when puppet is run.

Manual steps:

Once run, on the puppet master do the following:

sudo service puppetmaster status # test that puppet master was installed
sudo service puppetmaster stop
sudo puppet master --verbose --no-daemonize
# Ctrl+C to kill puppet master
sudo service puppetmaster start
sudo puppet cert list --all # check for 'puppet' cert

On the puppet nodes:

sudo service puppet status # test that agent was installed
sudo puppet agent --test --waitforcert=60 # initiate certificate signing request (CSR)

Back on the puppet master:

sudo puppet cert list # should see 'node01.example.com' cert waiting for signature
sudo puppet cert sign --all # sign the agent node certs
sudo puppet cert list --all # check for signed certs
